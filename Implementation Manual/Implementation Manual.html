<h2>DM42 Calculator Compiler Implementation</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This compiler translates high-level language programs into keystrokes
for the DM42 calculator. These programs will run on unmodified DM42
calculators – no firmware flashing required. Most programs will also run
on the Free42 emulator provided they do not use any unsupported DM42
extensions. Compiled programs make use of the DM42's extended stack mode
(NSTK). "Dynamic Stack Extension" should be enabled in the calculator's
settings.</p>
<p>The compiler is implemented using the “parsable objects” library
described <a href='https://github.com/jackbrennan-creator/Simple-Reflexive-Parsing'>here</a>. Compiler construction using this library
involves writing neither a lexical analyser, nor a parser, but starts
with the definition of the components of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
for the language to be compiled. The simplest way to understand the
compiler's implementation is through an understanding of the processes
applied in its development. This document describes these in detail.
Note that the language implementation described below, is a simplified
version of what the compiler actually implements and that the names used
for various components are not necessarily the same as those used in the
actual compiler. This document should be read in conjunction with the
compiler user manual available <a href='https://github.com/jackbrennan-creator/DM42-Calculator-Compiler'>here</a>.</p>
<h3>Conversional Compiler Construction</h3>
<p>Development starts with the definition of a grammatical description
of the source language to be compiled, i.e. its syntax. A lexical
analyser, or tokenizer, is then constructed to turn a stream of
characters into a stream of symbols called lexemes, which represent the
primary elements of the language, e.g. identifiers, numbers, reserved
words and punctuation symbols. A parser is then constructed based on the
grammar for the language. This consumes a stream of lexemes in order to
workout if it constitutes a valid program, and if so, which lexemes
correspond to which parts of the grammar, e.g. an identifier followed by
an equals sign, followed by further lexemes which form an expression, is
an assignment statement. The parser does not care how identifiers are
spelt as long as their appearance in the lexeme stream conforms with the
grammar. Any sequences which do not conform with the grammar are flagged
as syntax errors.</p>
<p>Once the parser is able to recognise correct strings in the language,
and to reject incorrect ones, it is time to add operations to construct
an AST upon which all subsequent processing stages will depend, e.g.
semantic analysis, code generation etc.</p>
<h3>Compiler Construction Using Parsable
Objects</h3>
<p>In contrast to the above, the first thing to be defined is the
structure of the AST. The parsable objects library will deduce the
necessary lexical analyser and parsing operations directly from this.
The AST documents how fundamental components of the language are
assembled to form programs. The ontologies of most programming languages
can be described in terms of a small number of categories, e.g.
statements, expressions and declarations. In the language considered
here, there are a number of different sorts of statement in the
statement category, e.g. assignment statements, if statements, for
statements etc. Components of the AST must be defined for each of
these.</p>
<p>The AST component required to represent assignment statements can be
described by the following class.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class assignment_statement
{
  public string     id;
  public expression value;
}
</pre>
<p>Assuming a further definition of the class expression, this simply
states that an assignment statement consists of a character string
representing an identifier and an expression. It says nothing about how
it will be written down in the source language. Because of this, an
equally valid definition would be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class assignment_statement
{
  public expression value;
  public string     id;
}
</pre>
<p>A complete AST definition must include such classes for all the
different kinds of statements, expressions and declarations in the
language.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class if_statement
{
  public expression condition;
  public statement  then_action;
  public statement  else_action;
}
public class for_statement
{
  public string     variable_identifier;
  public expression initial_value;
  public expression final_value;
  public statement  controlled_statement;
}
...etc
</pre>
<p>At this stage it is convenient to express the fact that all these
different sorts of statements are in fact part of the category of
statements. Inheritance provides a mechanism for doing this. In the
following example all the different statement classes are both nested
within a statement class and inherit from it. Thus any operation which
applies to statements in general can be applied to any of the more
specific sorts of statement.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class statement
{
  public class assignment_statement: statement
  {
    public string     id;
    public expression value;
  }
  
  public class if_statement: statement
  {
    public expression condition;
    public statement  then_action;
    public statement  else_action;
  }
  public class for_statement: statement
  {
    public string     variable_identifier;
    public expression initial_value;
    public expression final_value;
    public statement  controlled_statement;
  }
  ...etc
}
</pre>
<p>The parsable objects library defines a class called “parsable”, and
when properly defined, instances of any class which inherits from
“parsable” can be produced by parsing a suitable source text. In order
for this to work, the next step is to use the C# attribute mechanism to
augment the AST classes to indicate how the corresponding elements of
the language will be written down in the source. The following example
shows one way this could be done for the assignment statement class.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
using parsable_objects;
public class statement: parsable
{ 
  public class assignment_statement: statement
  {
    [Parse(1)     ] public identifier  id;
    [Parse(2, &quot;=&quot;)] public punctuation equals;
    [Parse(3)     ] public expression  value;
    [Parse(4, &quot;;&quot;)] public punctuation semicolon;
  }
  …etc
}
</pre>
<p>Notice that the statement class has been made to inherit from the
"parsable" class provided by the passible objects library. This implies
that all of the different sorts of statements will inherit from parsable
too. In addition the "Parse" attribute, defined by the library, has been
added to the original field definitions of the statement classes. Two
extra fields of type "punctuation", also defined by the library, have
been added. Further, the library type "identifier" has been substituted
for "string" in the first field definition. Identifiers represent
restricted strings of characters which conform to the usual rules for
program identifiers, e.g. they must start with a letter, which is
followed by further letters, digits and underscores.</p>
<p>Before going into further details it should be pointed out that, if
all the other AST classes, including "expression", are augmented in the
same way, the parsable objects library will be able to parse objects of
type statement as shown below. For a more detailed description of how it
does this, see the passible object library documentation.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
try
{
  var s = parsable.parse&lt;statement&gt;(&quot;a = b + c * d;&quot;);
}
catch (parse_error error)
{
  //Tell the user what and where.
}
</pre>
<p>The result of this would be an object of type assignment statement
with its fields instantiated appropriately, i.e. the identifier field
would refer to an identifier spelt "a", and the value field would refer
to a hierarchy of objects of type expression representing "b + c *
d".</p>
<p>The meaning of the field attributes can now be described in more
detail;</p>
<pre class="scroll">
    [Parse(1)     ] public identifier  id;
    [Parse(2, &quot;=&quot;)] public punctuation equals;
    [Parse(3)     ] public expression  value;
    [Parse(4, &quot;;&quot;)] public punctuation semicolon;
</pre>
<p>Only fields marked with the Parse attribute are considered during
parsing. A parsable class can define other fields, properties and
methods which are not involved in the parsing process. The first
parameter of Parse is always a sequence number telling the parser the
order in which fields are required to appear regardless of the order in
which they are defined. Further parameters may be added to Parse
attributes according to the types of the fields with which they are
associated. In the case of the punctuation field used in the assignment
statement class, the string following the sequence number defines the
punctuation characters the parser will look for in the source. To change
from a C-style assignment to an Algol style assignment, the "="
character would be replaced with ":=".</p>
<p>A slightly more complex example is represented by the if statement
class. It is shown below augmented with the attributes the parser will
require to create objects of this type from a source text.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class if_statement: statement
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;if&quot;)] public reserved_word       if_word;
  [Parse(2, &quot;(&quot;) ] public punctuation         open;
  [Parse(3)      ] public expression          condition;
  [Parse(4, &quot;)&quot;) ] public punctuation         close;
  [Parse(5)      ] public statement           then_action;
  [Parse(6)      ] public Optional&lt;else_part&gt; else_action;
}
public class else_part: parsable
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;else&quot;)] public reserved_word else_word;
  [Parse(2)        ] public statement     else_statement;
}
</pre>
<p>This example introduces the reserved word type defined by the
library. Unlike the identifier type which will match any valid sequence
of characters in the source text, it represents fixed sequences of
characters which must be present in the source text, e.g. if, else, for,
while, etc. The rest of the fields specify that the reserved word if
must be followed by a valid expression enclosed in brackets which are
then followed by a then action statement, optionally followed by an else
action. When a field is defined by the generic library type Option, it
indicates to the parser that the source text corresponding to the
parameter type may be missing. Notice that the else part class inherits
from parsable, but not from statement because, by themselves, else parts
do not represent statements.</p>
<p>The next two examples show how sequences of elements are described.
The first example shows how a parameter list, which might follow a
function name in an expression, can be defined. The intension here is to
define source text consisting of a pair of brackets containing zero or
more valid expressions, separated by commas, e.g. (x, y + 1,
sin(z)).</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class parameter_list: parsable
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;(&quot;) ] public punctuation      open;
  [Parse(2, &quot;,&quot;) ] public List&lt;expression&gt; parameters;
  [Parse(3, &quot;)&quot;) ] public punctuation      close;
}
</pre>
<p>The parser will interpret the use of the generic collection type List
as indicating that zero or more sequences of characters, representing
its element type, may be present in the source text. The ", " character
in the Parse attribute specifies that these must be separated by
commas.</p>
<p>The second example shows how a block of statements can be defined.
The intension here is to define source text consisting of a pair of
braces containing zero or more valid statements, e.g. { a = 1; b = 2; c
= a + b; }. In this case there is no separator as the semicolons are
part of the text for the individual statement types. Blocks themselves
do not require a semicolon following them. Details such as the presence
of declarations in blocks have been omitted here.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public class block: statement
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;{&quot;)] public punctuation     open;
  [Parse(2)     ] public List&lt;statement&gt; statements;
  [Parse(3, &quot;}&quot;)] public punctuation     close;
}
</pre>
<p>Notice that, in this case, the block class inherits from the
statement class, and thus blocks may occur anywhere a statement is
valid, e.g. as the then_action of an if statement. In addition, as no
separator symbol is specified in the Parse attribute for the
List&lt;statement&gt; field, the parser will not expect any separators
to occur between statements.</p>
<p>The AST for the DM42 high-level language is defined using the
techniques demonstrated above. Altogether there are 6 classes
representing declarations, including the structure of a program, 20
classes representing statements and 17 classes representing expressions.
Most of these are only 4 or 5 lines long excluding the class headers.
Once all the AST classes are defined, complete programs can be parsed to
produce specified ASTs as follows (in this example the error handling is
omitted).</p>
<pre class="scroll">
var source = new source_reader(&lt;string, FileStream or StreamReader&gt;);
var p = parsable.parse&lt;program&gt;(source);
</pre>
<p>The library provides a source_reader class which performs lexical
analysis using the set of punctuation symbols and reserved words
specified in the AST class definitions. It can accept input directly
from a string, FileStream or a StreamReader. The AST produced by the
parse operation will contain all the information present in the source
and can be traversed to perform subsequent compilation operations, e.g.
semantic analysis and code generation.</p>
<h3>Semantic Analysis</h3>
<p>C# provides two mechanisms which make adding processing stages to the
existing AST classes very easy. The first of these is the partial class
mechanism. In the following example, two declarations of the assignment
statement class are shown. Declaring the same class twice in the same
namespace is not allowed, but by adding the word partial before the word
class, it is possible to have two, or more, definitions of the same
class provided that fields, properties, methods, etc., are not
duplicated between them (Visual Studio's forms designer uses this
mechanism to separate automatically generated definitions from those
added the the programmer).</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class assignment_statement: statement
{
  [Parse(1)     ] public identifier  variable_id;
  [Parse(2, &quot;=&quot;)] public punctuation equals;
  [Parse(3)     ] public expression  value;
  [Parse(4, &quot;;&quot;)] public punctuation semicolon;
}
public partial class assignment_statement: statement
{
  public variable_definition variable;
}
</pre>
<p>In this case the first definition specifies the information needed by
the parser. The second definition specifies the information as it might
be required by a semantic analyser. The C# compiler simply collects all
the parts of the two declarations together and behaves as if they were
all written in the same place. However, from a program structuring
viewpoint, this mechanism allows all the details of syntax specification
to be kept separate from the details of semantic analysis, because the
two class declarations may be placed in separated files.</p>
<p>This mechanism becomes more powerful when it is combined with the use
of C# interfaces. In its simplest form an interface may be used to
define those methods which a class implementing it must provide,
although other requirements may also be specified.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
interface analysable
{
  void analyse(program_data data);
}
</pre>
<p>This interface specifies that any class implementing it must provide
an analyse method which returns no result, but accepts a single
parameter of type program data. Suppose the program data class provides
operations for maintaining, amongst other things, a dictionary of all
the named elements of a program, e.g. variables, functions and
parameters. This would allow semantic analysis operations to look-up
identifiers to find their corresponding definitions and to check that
they are defined before they are used. If all the AST classes are made
to implement the analysable interface, the details of analysing each
language element can be encapsulated within the analyse method associate
with its corresponding AST class. All of these methods would share
access to the same program data object.</p>
<p>The original syntax definitions in the assignment statement class,
embedded in the statement class, can be augmented with the word
partial.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class statement: parsable
{ 
  public class assignment_statement: statement
  {
    [Parse(1)     ] public identifier  variable_id;
    [Parse(2, &quot;=&quot;)] public punctuation equals;
    [Parse(3)     ] public expression  value;
    [Parse(4, &quot;;&quot;)] public punctuation semicolon;
  }
  …etc.
}
</pre>
<p>In a separate file, a further partial definition of the class can be
created (see below). The statement class already inherits from the
library's parsable class, and here it is added to the set of classes
which implement the analysable interface. All of its subclasses,
including the assignment statement class, inherit the requirement to
implement the analysable interface. An analyse method can now be added
to the assignment statement class, to override the analysis method of
the parent statement class, and to perform the specific analysis
required for assignment statements, i.e. retrieving the variable
declaration associated with the identifier field, and analysing the
expression field. A reference to the variable declaration referred to by
the identifier is retained for later use by the code generation classes.
This is equivalent to folding the AST into a graph and is important when
nested scopes are allowed in a language.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class statement: analysable
{ 
  public class assignment_statement: statement
  {
    public variable_declaration variable;
    public override void analyse(program_data data)
    {
      variable = data.get_variable_declaration(variable_id.spelling);
      if (variable == null) throw new analysis_error(&quot;Undefined variable &quot; + id.spelling);
      else value.analyse(data);
    } 
  }
  …etc.
  public virtual void analyse(program_data data)
  {
  }
}
</pre>
<p>As a further example, here is the original definition of the if
statement class made partial.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class if_statement: statement
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;if&quot;)] public reserved_word       if_word;
  [Parse(2, &quot;(&quot;) ] public punctuation         open;
  [Parse(3)      ] public expression          condition;
  [Parse(4, &quot;)&quot;) ] public punctuation         close;
  [Parse(5)      ] public statement           then_action;
  [Parse(6)      ] public Optional&lt;else_part&gt; else_action;
}
public partial class else_part: parsable
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;else&quot;)] public reserved_word else_word;
  [Parse(2)        ] public statement     else_statement;
}
</pre>
<p>And here is its analysable definition. Notice how each analysis
method arranges to analyse its sub-components, passing on a reference to
the same program data object.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class if_statement: statement
{
  public override void analyse(program_data data)
  {
    condition.analyse(data);
    then_action.analyse(data);
    if (else_action.Defined) else_action.Value.analyse(data);
  } 
}
public partial class else_part: analysable
{
  public void analyse(program_data data)
  {
    else_statement.analyse(data);
  } 
}
</pre>
<p>Again, if the processes illustrated above are repeated, filling in
the implementations of all analyse methods of all the AST classes, the
end result is a complete semantic analyser.</p>
<h3>Code Generation</h3>
<p>Code generation is implemented in much the same way as semantic
analysis. First, a new interface is defined.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
interface generable 
{
  void generate(program_data data);
}  
</pre>
<p>New partial class definitions can then be created for each AST class,
and these can be made to implement the generable interface. Again, all
these definitions can be grouped together a in new file. The generate
methods can then be defined independently for each AST class, just as
the analyse methods were implemented for the semantic analyser. As a
result of this, each AST class will be parsable, analysable and
generable. The following example shows how the assignment statement,
nested within the statement class, might be made generable.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class statement: generable
{ 
  public class assignment_statement: statement
  {
    public override void generate(program_data data)
    {
      value.generate(data);
      data.output.write_store(variable.register);
    } 
  }
  …etc.
  public virtual void generate(program_data data)
  {
  }
}
</pre>
<p>This definition is based on a number of assumptions. Firstly, that
during the analysis of variable declarations, not described here, a
calculator register is allocated to store each declared variable.
Secondly, that the program data class provides an output stream for
writing keystrokes via a set of methods corresponding to calculator
functions. In this case, if the value of the register field is 1, it
should write STO 01. Thirdly, that the keystrokes generated for the
value expression will result in its value being left of the stack.</p>
<p>The next example shows how keystrokes for an if statement might be
generated. The assumptions made here are that the program data object
can allocate unique label numbers, and that the keystroke output stream
supports operations for writing both label definitions, e.g. LBL 03, and
gotos, e.g. GTO 03. Further, its is assumed that the generate operation
for the condition will write the keystrokes for evaluating and comparing
two expressions followed by a conditional command, e.g. X=0?, which will
only cause execution of the following command if the condition is
false.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class if_statement: statement
{
  public override void generate(program_data data)
  {
    int end_label = data.allocate_label();
    condition.generate(data);
    if (!else_action.Defined) 
    {
      data.output.write_goto(end_label);
      then_action.generate(data);
    }
    else
    {
      int else_label = data.allocate_label();
      data.output.write_goto(else_label);
      then_action.generate(data);
      data.output.write_goto(end_label);
      data.output.write_label(else_label);
      else_action.Value.generate(data);
    }
    data.output.write_label(end_label);
  } 
}
public partial class else_part: generable
{
  public void generate(program_data data)
  {
    else_statement.generate(data);
  } 
}
</pre>
<p>When all of the generate methods have been defined for all of the AST
classes, the compiler is complete. The final compiler can be seen as a
collection of miniature compilers, one for each language construct
represented by an AST class. The components of the complete complier can
now be executed as follows (Exception handling has been omitted).</p>
<pre class="scroll">
var source = new source_reader(&lt;string, FileStream or StreamReader&gt;);
var p      = parsable.parse&lt;program&gt;(source);
var data   = new program_data();
p.analyse (data);
p.generate(data);
string keystokes = data.output.ToString();
</pre>
<p>The parsable objects library supports a number of facilities which
simplify the development steps described above. As soon as a
sufficiently complete set of AST classes has been produced to allow the
language to be parsed, i.e. before analysis and keystroke generation,
the library can generated the EBNF text of the grammar the AST classes
define. This is useful both for documentation and as a check that the
language meets requirements. In addition, the library can generate the
text of new sets of partial AST classes which implement specified
interfaces. The analysable and generable versions of the AST classes for
this compiler were produced using this facility.</p>
<p>New language features can be added, and parsed via new AST classes
specifying their syntax, before their analyse and generate methods are
defined. Thus incremental language evolution is possible. The
organisation of the compiler project is shown below.</p>
<img src="figure_1.jpg">
<p>There are separate folders for each of the three language component
categories, declarations, statements and expressions (expr). Within each
folder the definitions of the partial AST classes for syntax, analysis
and generation are contained in separate files. The support folder
contains the definitions of the program data class, the exception
classes for analyser and general compiler errors, and the DM42 source
builder. The latter is an extended version of the source builder class
provided by the parsable objects library, which is itself an extension
of the .Net StringBuilder class. It implements the operations required
for keystroke output. The user interface is provided by the compiler
form and the standard.init file containing the standard function
definitions is copied to the executable folder when the project is
built.</p>
<h3>Extending the Compiler</h3>
<p>Adding new features to the high-level language involves the
definition of new syntax, analysis and generator components for each new
language component. For example, to add a "repeat" statement which will
execute its controlled statements one or more times (a while statement
executes its controlled statement zero or more times), the first thing
to do is to add a new parsable class to the existing AST classes.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class repeat_statement: statement
{
  [Parse(1, &quot;repeat&quot;)] public reserved_word   repeat_word;
  [Parse(2)          ] public List&lt;statement&gt; controlled_statements;
  [Parse(3, &quot;until&quot;) ] public reserved_word   until_word;
  [Parse(4)          ] public comparison      condition;
  [Parse(5, &quot;;&quot;)     ] public punctuation     semicolon;
}
</pre>
<p>This defines a new statement which consists of a sequence of
statements contained between the reserved words "repeat" and "until" and
followed by a termination condition, followed by a semicolon. For
example:-</p>
<pre class="scroll">
repeat
  b = b * a;
  a = a – 1;
until a = 0;
</pre>
<p>Adding this new class within the existing statement class will allow
the compiler to parse such statements, but they will not be analysed and
no keystrokes will be generated for them. The next step is therefore to
augment the repeat_statement class to make it analysable.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class repeat_statement: statement
{
  public override void analyse(program_data data)
  {
    foreach (var s in controlled_statements) s.analyse(data);
    condition.analyse(data);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The new definition shown here overrides the default analyse method
for statements. This will cause all of the statements between "repeat"
and "until" to be analysed, followed by analysis of the condition. Any
use of undeclared variables or functions will be flagged by this
process.</p>
<p>Finally the repeat_statement class can be made generable so that
keystrokes can be generated to allow such statements to be executed.</p>
<pre class="scroll">
public partial class repeat_statement: statement
{
  public override void generate(program_data data)
  {
    int continue_label = data.allocate_label();
    data.output.write_label(continue_label);
    foreach (var s in controlled_statements) s.generate(data);
    condition.generate(data);
    data.output.write_goto(continue_label);
  }
}

<p>This will generate a new label before the first statement between
"repeat" and "until". Following this will be the keystrokes for all the
statements in the list. Generation of the condition will end with a
conditional command which skips the following goto if the condition is
true, leading to termination of the repeat loop. If the goto is
executed, the loop will be repeated from the first statement. As with
previous examples some details have been omitted here, e.g. the extra
keystrokes needed to drop unwanted values from the stack after execution
of the keystrokes generated for the condition.</p>
<p>Taken together the three new definitions above represent a
mini-compiler for repeat statements.</p>
